# burger logger
![MIT  ](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-License-orange)


## Description
This project required creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I followed the MVC design pattern using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app. Handlebars was used to generate the HTML. The project was then loaded to heroku for use with the JawsDB MySQL add-on as the database.
